# This project is for practicing a shared repository.
# In particular, we will use it to illustrate how to MERGE git CONFLICTS.

    # TODO 2:  At the "same" time:
    #  Person 1:  Replace YYY in the following with "Bilbo".
    #  Person 2:  Replace YYY in the following with "Frodo".
    #  Both commit-and-push, thus creating a CONFLICT.
    #  Then resolve the conflict by keeping "Bilbo".
