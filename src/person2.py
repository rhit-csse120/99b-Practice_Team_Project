# This project is for practicing a shared repository.
# In particular, we will use it to illustrate how to MERGE git CONFLICTS.

    print("My name is XXX.")

    # TODO 2:  At the "same" time:
    #  Person 2:  Replace YYY in the following with "Sam".
    #  Person 3 (or person 1 if you are a two-person team):
    #             Replace YYY in the following with "Pippin".
    #  Both commit-and-push, thus creating a CONFLICT.
    #  Then resolve the conflict by keeping "Sam".
