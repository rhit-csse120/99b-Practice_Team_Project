# This project is for practicing a shared repository.
# In particular, we will use it to illustrate how to MERGE git CONFLICTS.

# If you are a two-person team, you may ignore this file.

    #  Person 3:  Replace YYY in the following with "Frodo".
    #  Person 1:  Replace YYY in the following with "Sam".
    #  Both commit-and-push, thus creating a CONFLICT.
    #  Then resolve the conflict by keeping "Frodo".
